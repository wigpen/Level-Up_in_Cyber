# LEVELLING-UP IN CYBER
You are probably here because you have some sort of contact with you and I have promoted this or you happily stumbled across it in your Github adventures.
I tend to lean more towards defence than the offence of Red Teaming and Pen testing, however a well-rounded cyber will know a bit of everything and be able to do a bit of everything.

The order presented here is not the order things have to be done it ... it is a suggestion and sometimes suggestions are wrong ... personally I jump between modules, paths, specific rooms depending on what is going on in my world and what topic comes up that I don't know about.

Most of the content is created/curated/done-by TryHackMe, I use them because they have a balance between defence and offence and cater for both types of teams and not just hackers/red teamers/pen testers ... us blue's need love too.

| Book Title	| Author	| Synopsis	|
|-------------| --------| ----------------------------------------------------|
| The Cuckoos Egg	| Clifford Stoll	| Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage is a his first-person account of the hunt for a computer hacker who broke into a computer at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).	|
| At Large: The Strange Case of the World's Biggest Internet Invasion | David H. Freeman & Charles C. Mann	| Hailed as "a chilling portrait" by The Boston Globe and "a crafty thriller" by Newsweek, this astonishing story of an obsessive hacker promises to change the way you look at the Internet forever.	|
| Crime Dot Com: From Viruses to Vote Rigging, How Hacking Went Global | Geoff White	| Geoff White charts the astonishing development of hacking, from its birth among the ruins of the Eastern Bloc to its coming of age as the most pervasive threat to our connected world. He takes us inside the workings of real-life cybercrimes, revealing how the tactics of high-tech crooks are now being harnessed by nation states. From Ashley Madison to election rigging, Crime Dot Com is a thrilling account of hacking, past and present, and of what the future might hold. |
| The Lazarus Heist: From Hollywood to High Finance: Inside North Korea's Global Cyber War | Geoff White | Meet the Lazarus Group, a shadowy cabal of hackers accused of working on behalf of the North Korean state. It's claimed that they form one of the most dangerous criminal enterprises on the planet, having stolen more than $1bn in an international crime spree. Their targets allegedly include central banks, Hollywood film studios and even the British National Health Service. North Korea denies the allegations, saying the accusations are American attempts to tarnish its image.	|
| This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race | Nicole Perlroth | |Zero day: a software bug that allows a hacker to break in and scamper through the world’s computer networks invisibly until discovered. One of the most coveted tools in a spy's arsenal, a zero day has the power to tap into any iPhone, dismantle safety controls at a chemical plant and shut down the power in an entire nation - just ask the Ukraine.	|
| Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World | Joseph Menn | Cult of the Dead Cow is the tale of the oldest, most respected, and most famous American hacking group of all time. Though until now it has remained mostly anonymous, its members invented the concept of hacktivism, released the top tool for testing password security, and created what was for years the best technique for controlling computers from afar, forcing giant companies to work harder to protect customers. They contributed to the development of Tor, the most important privacy tool on the net, and helped build cyberweapons that advanced US security without injuring anyone. 	|
| Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin's Most Dangerous Hackers | Andy Greenberg | In 2014, the world witnessed the start of a mysterious series of cyberattacks. Targeting American utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes grew ever more brazen. They culminated in the summer of 2017, when the malware known as NotPetya was unleashed, penetrating, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the world's largest businesses - from drug manufacturers to software developers to shipping companies. At the attack's epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems shut down. Hospitals went dark. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented 10 billion dollars in damage - the largest, most devastating cyberattack the world had ever seen.	|
| Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency | Andy Greenberg | Over the last decade, a single innovation has massively fueled digital black markets: cryptocurrency. Crime lords inhabiting lawless corners of the internet have operated more freely—whether in drug dealing, money laundering, or human trafficking—than their analog counterparts could have ever dreamed of. By transacting not in dollars or pounds but in currencies with anonymous ledgers, overseen by no government, beholden to no bankers, these black marketeers have sought to rob law enforcement of their chief method of cracking down on illicit finance: following the money.	|
| Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon | Kim Zetter | In January 2010, inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency noticed that centrifuges at an Iranian uranium enrichment plant were failing at an unprecedented rate. The cause was a complete mystery - apparently as much to the technicians replacing the centrifuges as to the inspectors observing them.	|
| The Hacker and the State: Cyber Attacks and the New Normal of Geopolitics | Ben Buchanan | Packed with insider information based on interviews, declassified files, and forensic analysis of company reports, The Hacker and the State sets aside fantasies of cyber-annihilation to explore the real geopolitical competition of the digital age. Tracing the conflict of wills and interests among modern nations, Ben Buchanan reveals little-known details of how China, Russia, North Korea, Britain, and the United States hack one another in a relentless struggle for dominance. His analysis moves deftly from underseas cable taps to underground nuclear sabotage, from blackouts and data breaches to billion-dollar heists and election interference. 	|
| Cyber Wars: Hacks That Shocked the Business World | Charles Arthur | Cyber Wars gives you the dramatic inside stories of some of the world's biggest cyber attacks. These are the game-changing hacks that make organisations around the world tremble and leaders stop and consider just how safe they really are. Charles Arthur provides a gripping account of why each hack happened, what techniques were used, what the consequences were and how they could have been prevented. 	|
| Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution: 25th Anniversary Edition | Steven Levy | Steven Levy's classic book traces the exploits of the computer revolution's original hackers - those brilliant and eccentric nerds from the late 1950s through the early '80s who took risks, bent the rules, and pushed the world in a radical new direction. With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, Hackers is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers.	|
| Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture | David Kushner (narrated by Wil Wheaton) | Masters of Doom is the amazing true story of the Lennon and McCartney of video games: John Carmack and John Romero. Together, they ruled big business. They transformed popular culture. And they provoked a national controversy. More than anything, they lived a unique and rollicking American Dream, escaping the broken homes of their youth to produce the most notoriously successful game franchises in history - Doom and Quake - until the games they made tore them apart. This is a story of friendship and betrayal, commerce and artistry - a powerful and compassionate account of what it's like to be young, driven, and wildly creative.	|
| Intercept: The Secret History of Computers and Spies | Gordon Corera | This is the exhilarating secret history of the melding of technology and espionage. Gordon Corera's compelling narrative, rich with historical details and characters, takes us from the Second World War to the internet age, revealing the astonishing extent of cyberespionage carried out today. 	|
| How Spies Think: Ten Lessons in Intelligence | David Omand | From the former director of GCHQ, learn the methodology used by the British intelligence agencies to reach judgements, establish the right level of confidence and act decisively. Intelligence officers discern the truth. They gather information - often contradictory or incomplete - and, with it, they build the most accurate possible image of the world. With the stakes at their absolute highest, they must then decide what to do.  	|
| We Are Bellingcat: An Intelligence Agency for the People | Eliot Higgins | Bellingcat, the home-grown investigative unit, is redefining the way we think about news, politics and the digital future. Here, their founder - a high-school dropout on a kitchen laptop - tells the story of how they created a whole new category of information-gathering, galvanising citizen journalists across the globe to expose war crimes and pick apart disinformation, using just their computers.	|
| Fancy Bears Go Phishing |   |   |
| Rinsed | Geoff White | Amazing, should be used as corporte training to reinfoce the dangers and complaceny that can be involved in allowing and/or facitilating unknowingly Money Laundering.  The signs you should watch out for etc. https://youtu.be/dSwOqKNmMdw?si=4G1lUeQ2a3h8IcCD | |

## Awkward Questions to Ask at an Interview
- When was your last maturity assessment, both internally conducted, and independantly assessed?
- Lumberjacks, log cutting ... will ellaborate later
- What intelligence do you generate internally?
- With what telemetry do you generate your intelligence?
- What teams assist in generating intelligence e.g. Hunt with their analysis and hunt investigations in to things such as but not limited to malware
- Minimum and maximum data retention periods for things like intelligence reports, telementry, metadata (ipfix/netflow) ...
