# LEVELLING-UP IN CYBER
You are probably here because you have some sort of contact with you and I have promoted this or you happily stumbled across it in your Github adventures.
I tend to lean more towards defence than the offence of Red Teaming and Pen testing, however a well-rounded cyber will know a bit of everything and be able to do a bit of everything.

The order presented here is not the order things have to be done it ... it is a suggestion and sometimes suggestions are wrong ... personally I jump between modules, paths, specific rooms depending on what is going on in my world and what topic comes up that I don't know about.
